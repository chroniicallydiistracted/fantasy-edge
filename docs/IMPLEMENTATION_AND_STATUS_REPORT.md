# Implementation and Status Report

Date: 2025-09-03

## Phase Overview
- **Phase 0 – Infra & CI Skeleton**: Completed. Docker-compose spins up API, web, Redis, Postgres, and worker; GitHub Actions run linting, type checking, tests, and Docker builds.
- **Phase 1 – Auth Foundations**: Completed. User and OAuth token models with Fernet encryption, JWT session cookies, debug bypass, and tests.
- **Phase 2 – Yahoo OAuth Flow**: Completed. Login and callback endpoints, state validation, token refresh, and user info retrieval.
- **Phase 3 – Yahoo League Read Endpoints**: Completed. Yahoo client and endpoints for leagues, teams, rosters, and matchups with automatic token refresh.
- **Phase 4 – Database Schema & Seeding**: Completed. Comprehensive models and migrations plus idempotent seeding for league 528886.
- **Phase 5 – Free Data Integrations**: Completed. Celery tasks ingest nflverse data, injuries, and weather; WAF calculations and caching implemented.
- **Phase 6 – Scoring Engine**: Completed. Offense, kicker, defense, and IDP scoring utilities with golden tests.
- **Phase 7 – Projection Pipeline**: Completed. Worker persists offensive projections to the database and an API endpoint serves player projections with variance and category breakdowns.
- **Phase 8 – Lineup Optimization**: Initial optimizer package providing a backtracking algorithm to fill roster slots based on projected points, with unit tests.
- **Phase 9 – Waivers & Streamers**: Implemented Celery `waiver_shortlist` task and API endpoints for team waivers and DEF/IDP streamers with deterministic ranking tests.
- **Phase 10 – Frontend (Next.js)**: In progress. Added Yahoo login page, leagues table, matchups, waivers, streamers, and settings pages with client-side CSV import; Node-based tests cover arithmetic, waiver mapping, and CSV parsing.
- **Phase 11 – Scheduling**: Added Celery beat schedules for nightly projection sync, Tuesday waiver shortlist, and a configurable game-day refresh interval with unit tests.
- **Phase 12 – Security & Resilience**: Completed. Central logging masks secrets and emails, Yahoo client uses exponential backoff with jitter and snapshot support, CORS and cookie settings secured with tests.
- **Phase 13 – Docs & Deploy Config**: Completed. Added root `README.md`, Postman collection, Render and Vercel templates, and CI smoke test hitting `/health`.
- **Timezone Handling**: Replaced all uses of `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` across API modules and tests.

## Production Readiness
Phases 0–9 have passing tests and are suitable for production usage. Phase 10 frontend work has begun but is incomplete; Phase 11 scheduling and Phase 12 security are in place, and Phase 13 documentation is now available.

## Next Steps
Proceed to Spec2 for UI improvements and feature polish.
