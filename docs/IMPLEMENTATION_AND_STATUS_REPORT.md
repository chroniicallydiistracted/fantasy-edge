# Implementation and Status Report

Date: 2025-09-03

## Phase Overview
- **Phase 0 – Infra & CI Skeleton**: Completed. Docker-compose spins up API, web, Redis, Postgres, and worker; GitHub Actions run linting, type checking, tests, and Docker builds.
- **Phase 1 – Auth Foundations**: Completed. User and OAuth token models with Fernet encryption, JWT session cookies, debug bypass, and tests.
- **Phase 2 – Yahoo OAuth Flow**: Completed. Login and callback endpoints, state validation, token refresh, and user info retrieval.
- **Phase 3 – Yahoo League Read Endpoints**: Completed. Yahoo client and endpoints for leagues, teams, rosters, and matchups with automatic token refresh.
- **Phase 4 – Database Schema & Seeding**: Completed. Comprehensive models and migrations plus idempotent seeding for league 528886.
- **Phase 5 – Free Data Integrations**: Completed. Celery tasks ingest nflverse data, injuries, and weather; WAF calculations and caching implemented.
- **Phase 6 – Scoring Engine**: Completed. Offense, kicker, defense, and IDP scoring utilities with golden tests.
- **Phase 7 – Projection Pipeline**: Completed. Worker persists offensive projections to the database and an API endpoint serves player projections with variance and category breakdowns.
- **Phase 8 – Lineup Optimization**: Initial optimizer package providing a backtracking algorithm to fill roster slots based on projected points, with unit tests.
- **Phase 9 – Waivers & Streamers**: Implemented Celery `waiver_shortlist` task and API endpoints for team waivers and DEF/IDP streamers with deterministic ranking tests.
- **Phase 10 – Frontend (Next.js)**: In progress. Added Yahoo login page, leagues table, matchups, waivers, streamers, and settings pages with client-side CSV import; Node-based tests cover arithmetic, waiver mapping, and CSV parsing.
- **Phase 11 – Scheduling**: Added Celery beat schedules for nightly projection sync, Tuesday waiver shortlist, and a configurable game-day refresh interval with unit tests.
- **Phase 12 – Security & Resilience**: Completed. Central logging masks secrets and emails, Yahoo client uses exponential backoff with jitter and snapshot support, CORS and cookie settings secured with tests.
- **Phase 13 – Docs & Deploy Config**: Completed. Added root `README.md`, Postman collection, Render and Vercel templates, and CI smoke test hitting `/health`.
- **Timezone Handling**: Replaced all uses of `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` across API modules and tests.

## Audit and Phase 1 Fixes Implementation

### Background

A comprehensive audit of the Fantasy Edge repository was conducted against the vision document (THE_VISION.md) and audit prompt (AUDIT_PROMPT.md). The audit identified several critical issues that could impact the application's functionality, security, and reliability. The most significant finding was that the GameDay live feature was essentially non-functional due to an incomplete SSE implementation. Additionally, there were security concerns with placeholder secrets and configuration mismatches between development and production environments.

### What Was Done

#### 1. Yahoo Redirect URI Fix ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The Yahoo OAuth redirect URI in render.yaml was using the incorrect Render URL (https://fantasy-edge-api.onrender.com/auth/yahoo/callback) instead of the production URL (https://api.misfits.westfam.media/auth/yahoo/callback).
- **Implementation**: Updated the render.yaml file to use the correct production URL.
- **Why**: This fix ensures that the Yahoo OAuth flow will work correctly in the production environment, preventing authentication failures.

#### 2. CORS Configuration Improvements ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The CORS configuration in settings.py was hardcoded to include both localhost and the production origin, which is a security risk in production. Additionally, the CORS policy was overly permissive, allowing all methods and headers.
- **Implementation**:
  - Modified settings.py to create a more flexible CORS configuration that properly handles development and production environments through a new `cors_origins_list` property.
  - Updated main.py to use the new property and restrict CORS to necessary methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS) and headers (Content-Type, Authorization).
  - Fixed the .env file to properly set the CORS_ORIGINS.
  - Updated the test file to use the new property.
- **Why**: This fix improves security by properly restricting CORS to only necessary origins, methods, and headers, while still allowing development flexibility.

#### 3. Added Missing Environment Variables ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL environment variable was referenced in settings.py but not defined in the environment configuration files.
- **Implementation**: Added LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL to settings.py, .env, .env.example, and render.yaml with a default value of 8000ms.
- **Why**: This ensures that the live polling interval can be properly configured for different environments.

#### 4. SSE Implementation Enhancement ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The SSE endpoint in live.py was only sending generic heartbeats with no actual game data or league-specific context.
- **Implementation**: Modified the SSE endpoint to:
  - Accept league_key and week parameters
  - Include proper dependency injection for user authentication
  - Prepare the structure for Redis pub/sub implementation (though the actual Redis connection is still a placeholder)
- **Why**: This is a foundational fix for the GameDay live feature, which requires league-specific subscriptions to actual game data.

#### 5. Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: The README.md and .env.example files were missing documentation for the LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL environment variable.
- **Implementation**: Updated both files to include proper documentation for the new environment variable.
- **Why**: Ensures that developers deploying the application have all the necessary information to configure the environment correctly.

### Issues and Outstanding Items

1. **Redis Implementation for SSE**: While we've prepared the structure for Redis pub/sub in the SSE implementation, the actual Redis connection and pub/sub logic is still a placeholder. This needs to be fully implemented in Phase 2.

2. **SSE Client Error Handling**: The web client's SSE implementation in live.ts still lacks proper error handling and reconnection logic. This should be addressed in Phase 2.

3. **SSE Client Cleanup**: The web client doesn't properly clean up the EventSource connection on component unmount, which could lead to memory leaks.

4. **Health Check Endpoint**: While the health endpoint exists, it should be enhanced to include database connectivity checks and Redis connectivity checks.

5. **Live Game Data Pipeline**: The SSE implementation now accepts league and week parameters, but the actual game data pipeline from Yahoo/ESPN to Redis to the SSE endpoint is not yet implemented.

### Next Steps

1. **Phase 2 - Live Game Data Implementation**: Implement the Redis pub/sub system for live game data and enhance the SSE client with error handling and reconnection logic.

2. **Phase 3 - Feature Completeness**: Implement the play ticker functionality and add proper fallback mechanisms when primary data sources fail.

3. **Phase 4 - Documentation and Polish**: Update documentation with new configuration and add comprehensive error handling documentation.
