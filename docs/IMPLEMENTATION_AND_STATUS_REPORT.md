# Implementation and Status Report

Date: 2025-09-02

## Phase Overview
- **Phase 0 – Infra & CI Skeleton**: Completed. Docker-compose spins up API, web, Redis, Postgres, and worker; GitHub Actions run linting, type checking, tests, and Docker builds.
- **Phase 1 – Auth Foundations**: Completed. User and OAuth token models with Fernet encryption, JWT session cookies, debug bypass, and tests.
- **Phase 2 – Yahoo OAuth Flow**: Completed. Login and callback endpoints, state validation, token refresh, and user info retrieval.
- **Phase 3 – Yahoo League Read Endpoints**: Completed. Yahoo client and endpoints for leagues, teams, rosters, and matchups with automatic token refresh.
- **Phase 4 – Database Schema & Seeding**: Completed. Comprehensive models and migrations plus idempotent seeding for league 528886.
- **Phase 5 – Free Data Integrations**: Completed. Celery tasks ingest nflverse data, injuries, and weather; WAF calculations and caching implemented.
- **Phase 6 – Scoring Engine**: Completed. Offense, kicker, defense, and IDP scoring utilities with golden tests.
- **Phase 7 – Projection Pipeline**: Completed. Worker persists offensive projections to the database and an API endpoint serves player projections with variance and category breakdowns.
- **Phase 8 – Lineup Optimization**: Initial optimizer package providing a backtracking algorithm to fill roster slots based on projected points, with unit tests.
- **Phases 9–13**: Not started. Waivers/streamers, frontend pages, scheduling, security hardening, and deployment docs remain outstanding.
- **Timezone Handling**: Replaced all uses of `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` across API modules and tests.

## Production Readiness
Phases 0–8 have passing tests and are suitable for production usage. Later phases remain undeveloped.

## Next Steps
Focus on Phase 9 waivers/streamers and proceed through remaining phases as outlined in `docs/FOLLOWUP.md`.
