# Implementation and Status Report

## Phase 0 — Infra & CI Skeleton

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Changes Made
1. **API and Worker Health Endpoints**
   - Added a `/health` endpoint to the API service (already existed)
   - Implemented a `/healthz` endpoint for the worker service using FastAPI and Uvicorn
   - Updated the worker to run on port 8001 for health checks

2. **Docker Configuration**
   - Confirmed that services expose the required ports:
     - API: 8000
     - Web: 3000
     - Redis: 6379
     - Postgres: 5432
     - Worker: 8001
   - Updated docker-compose.dev.yml to expose the worker port and run the correct command

3. **GitHub Actions CI**
   - Created a comprehensive CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that:
     - Uses Python 3.11 for API and Worker
     - Uses Node 20 for Web
     - Runs ruff, black, mypy, and pytest for Python services
     - Runs pnpm lint and build for the web application
     - Builds Docker images for all three services

4. **Environment Files**
   - Created `.env.example` files for each service:
     - `apps/api/.env.example` with database, Redis, and API secrets
     - `services/worker/.env.example` with Redis and Celery configuration
     - `apps/web/.env.example` with API base URL and app configuration

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - The API already had proper CORS configuration allowing http://localhost:3000 by default

### Outstanding Issues

## Phase 1 — Auth Foundations

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Models and Migrations
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 00:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Created SQLAlchemy models for `User` and `OAuthToken` with the required fields
  - Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - Created an initial migration that creates the `users` and `oauth_tokens` tables
- **Reason**: These models are fundamental to the authentication system and need to be properly defined with relationships for user accounts and OAuth tokens.

#### 2. Token Encryption Service
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 01:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented a `TokenEncryptionService` using cryptography's Fernet
  - The service handles encryption and decryption of OAuth tokens at rest
  - Uses the `TOKEN_CRYPTO_KEY` environment variable for the encryption key
- **Reason**: OAuth tokens contain sensitive information and should be encrypted when stored in the database.

#### 3. JWT Session Management
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 02:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Created a `SessionManager` class for handling JWT tokens
  - Implemented JWT token creation and verification using HS256 algorithm
  - Set up session cookies with httpOnly and SameSite=Lax attributes
- **Reason**: Secure session management is critical for maintaining user authentication state.

#### 4. Debug Bypass
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 03:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Added a `/auth/session/debug` endpoint that sets a session cookie when the `X-Debug-User` header is present
  - The feature is gated by the `ALLOW_DEBUG_USER` environment variable
  - Created dependencies to handle authentication and debug user bypass
- **Reason**: Development teams often need a way to bypass authentication during development without affecting production security.

#### 5. Unit Tests
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 04:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented tests for token encryption roundtrip
  - Added tests for session token creation and verification
  - Created tests for the debug bypass functionality (enabled and disabled states)
  - Added tests for invalid debug headers
- **Reason**: Comprehensive testing ensures the authentication system works correctly and securely.

#### 6. Configuration Updates
- **Timestamp**: 2023-01-01 05:00:00
- **Changes**:
  - Updated settings to include session secret, token crypto key, and debug user flag
  - Updated environment example files with the new configuration values
  - Added necessary dependencies to requirements.txt
- **Reason**: Proper configuration management is essential for security and maintainability.
